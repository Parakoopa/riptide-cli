    :alt: Documentation Status

Riptide is a set of tools to manage development environments for web applications.
It's using container virtualization tools, such as `Docker <https://www.docker.com/>`_
to run all services needed for a project.

It's goal is to be easy to use by developers.
Riptide abstracts the virtualization in such a way that the environment behaves exactly
as if you were running it natively, without the need to install any other requirements
the project may have.

CLI Application
---------------

This repository contains the CLI application for Riptide. The library used for the CLI is `Click <https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/7.x/>`_.

The CLI application uses the Riptide lib package to manage files and to communicate with the container engine backend.

It can be installed via pip by installing ``riptide_lib``.
